                This was the first project from my time with General Assembly, being new to coding it honestly felt quite daunting in the beginning. However, I quickly learned to love the challenge that learning new technologies brings. I really owe my current passion for coding to this project. There is just something that is so satisfying about finding a solution to the issue that you've been stuck on.
